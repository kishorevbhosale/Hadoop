This is a hello world program of Hadoop.
Word Count Program:
This program counts the occurrences of the number of words in a file.

Basically, there are three classes for writing any hadoop mapreduce program.
1) Driver class, i.e. main class.
2) The mapper class used to map the input to different systems.
3) Reducer class used to collect output from different systems to single systems.
There are old API and a new API for Hadoop with small changes.
This program is written in the new API.
I/P: Sample text file containing any readable data. 

How to Run:

a) Start Hadoop: $start-all.sh
   verify using jps command 

b) move wcinput.txt file form local file system to hdfs
   $hadoop fs -put /home/kb/wcinput.txt /wc

c) go to directory where your code is available and openterminal 

	1) compile all java files:
   	   $ javac -classpath $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-core.jar *.java

	2) Create jar file: (hadoop can run or execute jar only)
   	   $ jar cvf Driver.jar *.class

	3) Running the jar file:
   	   // hadoop jar "JarFileName.jar" "NameOfMainClassFile" "InputPathforFile(HDFS location)" "OutputPath in hdfs" 	
   	   $ hadoop jar Driver.jar Driver /kb/wcinput.txt /wcoutput

d) output available in hdfs "/wcoutput" directory contains file "part-r-00000"
